15" MacBook Pro, mid '09 model
8GB DDR3 1066 RAM (which i routinely run out of... i dream about 16, but in the meantime i just kill a few chrome helpers)
2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo

changes to basic system configuration
(this is an incomplete list - i don't remember everything that i did)

- apple icon -> dock -> 'turn hiding on'
- terminal -> preferences -> settings -> check box 'use option as meta key'
- enable meta key in cocoa applications: http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20010729214616497
- sudo echo '127.0.0.1    ad.doubleclick.com' >> /etc/hosts
- system preferences -> desktop & screen saver -> desktop -> fill screen with a black image
- system preferences -> desktop & screen saver -> screen saver -> start screen saver never
- system preferences -> spotlight -> menu keyboard shortcut: alt-space
- system preferences -> keyboard -> keyboard -> use all F1 etc keys as function keys
- system preferences -> keyboard -> keyboard shortcuts -> keyboard & text input -> move focus to menu bar: ctrl-shift-f
- system preferences -> keyboard -> keyboard shortcuts -> application shortcuts -> show help menu: cmd-q, quit: something else (the substitutions i tried didn't work [for instance alt-shift-q. can anyone tell me why this doesn't work?], which sadly means i have to ctrl-shift-f, right, down, up, enter to exit programs, but the main point is that cmd-q no longer quits a program, so when i hit it accidentally instead of cmd-w, i'm okay)
- system preferences -> accounts -> login items -> quicksilver, firefox, chrome, emacs, thunderbird, and aTypeTrainer4Mac
- monthly battery care: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1490
